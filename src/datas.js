        name: "Burj Khalifa",
        about: "Rising 2,722 feet above the city (that's a whopping 160 stories), the Burj Khalifa proudly holds the title of world's tallest building. But that's not the only title this tower has got under its belt. The Burj Khalifa is also the tallest free-standing structure in the world and home to the highest outdoor observation deck in the world. You know what that means: gorgeous views. Visitors are invited to ride the elevator to the 124th floor for breathtaking city vistas extending all the way out to the Persian Gulf. Special telescopes also show scenes of the city from different points in time, allowing you to experience every stage of Dubai's history. You can also travel higher to the 148th floor, the world's highest observation deck, but it will cost you extra.",

        name: "The Colosseum",
        about: "This magnificent building is Rome’s shining glory (you know, the kind of stuff you see on postcards), and it’s even better in person than you can imagine. Built between 72-80 AD, it is the largest amphitheatre in the world and could hold up to 80,000 people. Local Romans used to come to see violent gladiator battles or animal hunts, but now it’s a lot more peaceful. We recommend buying tickets in advance, as the queues here can be crazy. But it is one hundred percent worth it once you get to the 5th level for that 360-degree view over the theatre.",
